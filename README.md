Hi, Iâ€™m @Spencer-Grady
  I am a mechanical engineering graduate currently pursuing a masters degree in computer engineering. 
 
  I have always enjoyed learning new things and diving deeper into the areas that peak my interest. 
  From being a child fascinated with space and the cosmos, to a college graduate who enjoys analyzing
  systems and what it takes to make them work, I have always found enjoyment in challenging myself. 
  
  Throughout my undergraduate coursework in mechanical engineering, I have gained expereince in 
  Matlab, Python, C++, Fortran 77, SolidEdge, AutoCad, GFSSP, and Nastran/Patran to analyze complex systems.
